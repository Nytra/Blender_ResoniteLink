Blender ResoniteLink addon using https://github.com/JackTheFoxOtter/ResoniteLink.py

To use the add-on you need to enable online-mode in the Blender preferences. Preferences->System->Network

The ResoniteLink panel will appear in the scene properties pane on the right-hand side of the Blender window.

Type in the websocket port and then hit connect and you can now use the "Send Scene" button to send the current scene hierarchy and meshes to Resonite.

Currently materials and textures won't be sent, nor anything else like lights.
